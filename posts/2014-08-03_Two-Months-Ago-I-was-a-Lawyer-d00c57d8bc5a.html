          Transitioning to Software Engineering</h2>
          <p name="70b3" id="70b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h2">I had a birthday this year despite disliking my
            job. Apparently, my daily fight against workflow did not slow down time. Practicing law is not a peculiar
            result for someone who went to law school, but nonetheless that’s what it felt like to me, and increasingly
            so, every week, month and year that passed.</p>
          <p name="2d41" id="2d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In retrospect, the seed that ultimately grew into
            my career move was planted in college. When curiosity was my only motivator, I studied math and physics as
            part of an applied math major that required that I take an introduction to programming class in C++. I loved
            that class because it appeared to almost completely flesh out the core of what I enjoyed most about my
            major. To quote one of my new favorite authors:</p>

            was <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">doing </em>and what I wanted <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to
              do </em>shrank every time I shed a reason for staying put.</p>
          <p name="8122" id="8122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently, I left corporate law and began a web
            development immersive, a 3 month intensive into computer science fundamentals, information architecture and
            web development. And now, a little over three months into a profession into which I look forward to
            investing my time and energy, I know I have a lot to learn. But I’m eager to share what I’m learning.</p>

            I don’t reveal so many nautical miles between myself and the boat, that I’ve missed the boat completely. But
            I also would love to hear what you think. I’m more concerned with learning than anything. If any of my posts
            find you, please comment. For anyone else that might stumble upon this post or another, I hope that it is
            relatable in some way. Happy coding!</p>
