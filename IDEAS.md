## Understanding Pointers/Call-by-reference by comparisons b/w c, go and JavaScript

## Go, a beautiful language
 - Rules around variable initialization and types
    - "zero value" initialization per type
    - implied types based on variable values with short/var variable declarations
    - tuple assignments / functions return multiple values
 - variables declared and scoped to if block. I've only ever seen this done with for loops
 - first class functions
 - named types and easy type conversion
 - easy scoping rules within package - everything visible everywhere
 - easy exports - capitalization
 - side effect operators illegal in expressions
 - switch statement
    - default no fallthrough
    - tagless / boolean expressions
 - structural typing
